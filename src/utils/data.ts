  <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size">A step-by-step guide for building stunning 3D scenes on the web with example prompts.</h2>
  
  
  
  <p><a href="https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/">React Three Fiber</a>&nbsp;(R3F) is a powerful React renderer for&nbsp;<a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>&nbsp;that simplifies building 3D graphics using React’s component-based architecture. Whether you’re building complex environments, animations, or interactive scenes, R3F makes it accessible—even if you’re not an expert at math or physics.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>With R3F support in&nbsp;<a href="https://v0.dev/">v0</a>, our AI-powered development assistant, you can incorporate 3D designs in your projects by chatting with v0 using natural language. Let’s explore how to use v0 and R3F to create interactive 3D scenes to elevate your web designs.</p>

  <p><a href="https://v0.dev/chat/6vbnxPgdUKd"><strong>Example prompt</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Create a 3D scene with a rotating sphere at the center and a stationary camera focused on it.</em></p>
  
  
  
  <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://vercel.com/blog/add-3d-to-your-web-projects-with-v0-and-react-three-fiber#key-3d-shapes-and-their-roles">Key 3D shapes and their roles</a></h3>
  
  
  
  <p>Basic 3D shapes like spheres, boxes, and planes are building blocks for more complex structures in 3D development.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>Spheres are perfect for representing objects like planets or balls and can easily be animated to simulate rolling or bouncing effects. Boxes, or cubes, provide the structure for everything from simple crates to intricate architectural forms, making them ideal for creating modular designs. And planes act as flat surfaces such as floors, walls, or backdrops, forming the foundation of your scene.</p>
  
  
  
  <p><strong>Example prompt:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Generate a 3D scene with a bouncing sphere that interacts with the ground.</em></p>
  
  
  
  <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://vercel.com/blog/add-3d-to-your-web-projects-with-v0-and-react-three-fiber#meshes-and-materials:-bringing-shapes-to-life">Meshes and materials: Bringing shapes to life</a></h3>
  
  
  
  <p>Meshes define the shape of 3D objects, while materials cover them with color, texture, and reflective properties. Choosing the right combination can make or break the realism of your scene.</p>
  
  
  
  <p><a href="https://v0.dev/chat/6vbnxPgdUKd"><strong>Example prompt</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Create a sphere with a high number of triangles for smoothness, and apply a metallic material to it.</em></p>
  
  
  
  <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://vercel.com/blog/add-3d-to-your-web-projects-with-v0-and-react-three-fiber#accessibility-in-3d-web-projects">Accessibility in 3D web projects</a></h3>
  
  
  
  <p>Ensuring accessibility in your 3D web projects is essential for creating inclusive and user-friendly experiences. Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and proper color contrast make your 3D projects usable for everyone.</p>
  
  
  
  <p><strong>Example Prompt:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Add alt text to key objects for screen reader compatibility.</em></p>

  <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://vercel.com/blog/add-3d-to-your-web-projects-with-v0-and-react-three-fiber#working-with-glb-files">Working with GLB files</a></h3>
  
  
  
  <p>GLB files are optimized for the web, containing all the necessary data for 3D models, including geometry, textures, and animations. With v0, you can import and use these models in your scene by dragging and dropping the file into the chat.</p>
  
  
  
  <p><strong>Example prompt:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Import the uploaded GLB model of a car and position it on a plane that acts as a road in the scene.</em></p>

  <p>The choice of camera plays a role in shaping how your scene is perceived.</p>
  
  
  
  <ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>A&nbsp;<strong>perspective camera</strong>&nbsp;mimics the way the human eye sees the world, making objects appear smaller as they fade into the distance—perfect for creating realistic depth and spatial relationships in your scene.</li>
  
  
  
  <li>An&nbsp;<strong>orthographic camera</strong>&nbsp;offers a different approach by maintaining consistent object sizes regardless of their distance from the camera, eliminating perspective distortion.</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  
  <p>Equally important is the role of lighting, which serves as the backbone of your scene’s mood and tone.</p>
  
  
  
  <ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li><strong>Ambient light</strong>&nbsp;provides a soft, even illumination that can make your scene feel natural and cohesive.</li>
  
  
  
  <li><strong>Directional light</strong>&nbsp;simulates the effect of sunlight, casting strong shadows and creating dramatic highlights.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href="https://v0.dev/chat/6vbnxPgdUKd"><strong>Example prompt</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Create a 3D scene with a rotating sphere at the center and a stationary camera focused on it.</em></p>
  
  
  
  <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://vercel.com/blog/add-3d-to-your-web-projects-with-v0-and-react-three-fiber#key-3d-shapes-and-their-roles">Key 3D shapes and their roles</a></h3>
  
  
  
  <p>Basic 3D shapes like spheres, boxes, and planes are building blocks for more complex structures in 3D development.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>Spheres are perfect for representing objects like planets or balls and can easily be animated to simulate rolling or bouncing effects. Boxes, or cubes, provide the structure for everything from simple crates to intricate architectural forms, making them ideal for creating modular designs. And planes act as flat surfaces such as floors, walls, or backdrops, forming the foundation of your scene.</p>
  
  
  
  <p><strong>Example prompt:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Generate a 3D scene with a bouncing sphere that interacts with the ground.</em></p>
  
  
  
  <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://vercel.com/blog/add-3d-to-your-web-projects-with-v0-and-react-three-fiber#meshes-and-materials:-bringing-shapes-to-life">Meshes and materials: Bringing shapes to life</a></h3>
  
  
  
  <p>Meshes define the shape of 3D objects, while materials cover them with color, texture, and reflective properties. Choosing the right combination can make or break the realism of your scene.</p>
  
  
  
  <p><a href="https://v0.dev/chat/6vbnxPgdUKd"><strong>Example prompt</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Create a sphere with a high number of triangles for smoothness, and apply a metallic material to it.</em></p>
  
  
  
  <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://vercel.com/blog/add-3d-to-your-web-projects-with-v0-and-react-three-fiber#accessibility-in-3d-web-projects">Accessibility in 3D web projects</a></h3>
  
  
  
  <p>Ensuring accessibility in your 3D web projects is essential for creating inclusive and user-friendly experiences. Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and proper color contrast make your 3D projects usable for everyone.</p>
  
  
  
  <p><strong>Example Prompt:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Add alt text to key objects for screen reader compatibility.</em></p>

  <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://vercel.com/blog/add-3d-to-your-web-projects-with-v0-and-react-three-fiber#working-with-glb-files">Working with GLB files</a></h3>
  
  
  
  <p>GLB files are optimized for the web, containing all the necessary data for 3D models, including geometry, textures, and animations. With v0, you can import and use these models in your scene by dragging and dropping the file into the chat.</p>
  
  
  
  <p><strong>Example prompt:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Import the uploaded GLB model of a car and position it on a plane that acts as a road in the scene.</em></p>

  <p>The choice of camera plays a role in shaping how your scene is perceived.</p>
  
  
  
  <ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>A&nbsp;<strong>perspective camera</strong>&nbsp;mimics the way the human eye sees the world, making objects appear smaller as they fade into the distance—perfect for creating realistic depth and spatial relationships in your scene.</li>
  
  
  
  <li>An&nbsp;<strong>orthographic camera</strong>&nbsp;offers a different approach by maintaining consistent object sizes regardless of their distance from the camera, eliminating perspective distortion.</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  
  <p>Equally important is the role of lighting, which serves as the backbone of your scene’s mood and tone.</p>
  
  
  
  <ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li><strong>Ambient light</strong>&nbsp;provides a soft, even illumination that can make your scene feel natural and cohesive.</li>
  
  
  
  <li><strong>Directional light</strong>&nbsp;simulates the effect of sunlight, casting strong shadows and creating dramatic highlights.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Basic 3D shapes like spheres, boxes, and planes are building blocks for more complex structures in 3D development.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>Spheres are perfect for representing objects like planets or balls and can easily be animated to simulate rolling or bouncing effects. Boxes, or cubes, provide the structure for everything from simple crates to intricate architectural forms, making them ideal for creating modular designs. And planes act as flat surfaces such as floors, walls, or backdrops, forming the foundation of your scene.</p>
  
  
  
  <p><strong>Example prompt:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Generate a 3D scene with a bouncing sphere that interacts with the ground.</em></p>

  <p>Meshes define the shape of 3D objects, while materials cover them with color, texture, and reflective properties. Choosing the right combination can make or break the realism of your scene.</p>
  
  
  
  <p><a href="https://v0.dev/chat/6vbnxPgdUKd"><strong>Example prompt</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Create a sphere with a high number of triangles for smoothness, and apply a metallic material to it.</em></p>

  <p>The choice of camera plays a role in shaping how your scene is perceived.</p>
  
  
  
  <ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>A&nbsp;<strong>perspective camera</strong>&nbsp;mimics the way the human eye sees the world, making objects appear smaller as they fade into the distance—perfect for creating realistic depth and spatial relationships in your scene.</li>
  
  
  
  <li>An&nbsp;<strong>orthographic camera</strong>&nbsp;offers a different approach by maintaining consistent object sizes regardless of their distance from the camera, eliminating perspective distortion.</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  
  <p>Equally important is the role of lighting, which serves as the backbone of your scene’s mood and tone.</p>
  
  
  
  <ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li><strong>Ambient light</strong>&nbsp;provides a soft, even illumination that can make your scene feel natural and cohesive.</li>

  <p>Basic 3D shapes like spheres, boxes, and planes are building blocks for more complex structures in 3D development.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>Spheres are perfect for representing objects like planets or balls and can easily be animated to simulate rolling or bouncing effects. Boxes, or cubes, provide the structure for everything from simple crates to intricate architectural forms, making them ideal for creating modular designs. And planes act as flat surfaces such as floors, walls, or backdrops, forming the foundation of your scene.</p>
